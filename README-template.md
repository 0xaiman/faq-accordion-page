## Overview
  The challenge ask you to create an accordion for FAQs page. From what I have seen, it is easier to start from mobile then port to desktop display. 

### The challenge

#### 1. Dropdown effect
I have the gist of idea that in order to apply "responsive-ness" of the dropdown, scripting is required.

This is done by applying trigger and detect them using onClick or eventListener to toggle class.

when the class is applied, the styling asscosciated with the class will appear.

`For example;
class=" dropdown"

/* apply click event*/

class="dropdown activated".

#### 2. COntainer position

The other issue, is that the position of the container , is centered when not activated. this causes a gap between the header image and the container.

<img src='/screenshot/1 not corrrect centered.png'>

This happens because the following styling is applied.(on body element)
<img src="/screenshot/body wrong.png">

To correct this, it is better to use the following

<img src="/screenshot/body correct.png">

This will push the container to topmost of the screen, but this can be fix using margin-top.
<img src="/screenshot/1.png">






### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
